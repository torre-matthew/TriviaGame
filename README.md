# Pixar themed TriviaGame
#### Pretty straighforward trivia game built using jquery.
#### I used bootstrap and a bit of custom styling.
#### The primary objective for this game was to demonstrate understanding of javascript timer function. Namely, setTimeout(); and setInterval();
#### I chose a pixar theme as I'm a big fan of their movies and I wanted to go with something that my 5 and 3 year olds would think was cool.
